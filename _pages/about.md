I am a Ph.D. student of [CVLab](https://usyd-cvlab.github.io/) at [School of Electrical and Information Engineering](https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/school-of-electrical-and-information-engineering.html), [the University of Sydney](https://sydney.edu.au/), supervised by Prof. [Dong Xu](https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/people/dong.xu.php). Before that, I received my B.Eng Degree (Hons) from [School of Electrical and Telecommunication](https://www.engineering.unsw.edu.au/electrical-engineering/), [the University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/), Australia. My undergraduate research supervisor was Prof. [John Fletcher](https://www.engineering.unsw.edu.au/electrical-engineering/professor-john-fletcher). My research interests lie in deep learning and computer vision. Specifically, I focus on CNN model compression and acceleration. You can find my CV here.
